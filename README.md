## Introduction

The project aims to provide a simple yet effective way to visualize relationships between variables in a dataset. The Iris dataset is used as a sample to demonstrate these visualizations.

## Features

- **Scatter Plot with D3.js**: Visualizes the relationship between sepal length and sepal width, with points colored by species.
- **Pairplot with Seaborn**: Provides a comprehensive view of relationships between all pairs of features in the Iris dataset.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3. **Install the required Python packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib seaborn
    ```

## Usage

### D3.js Scatter Plot

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the scatter plot.

### Seaborn Pairplot

1. Run the Python script to generate the pairplot:
    ```bash
    python script.py
    ```

## Technologies

- **D3.js**: A JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers.
- **Seaborn**: A Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
- **Matplotlib**: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
